# Rack
A virtual modular synthesizer.

# Concept
I was interested in sound production so I made this.

# Features
At this stage the base has only just been laid and the capabilities are very limited. Some of the available features include:
- Connect together any number of modules.
- Generate all kinds of waves.
- Listen to the waves (native sample rate, mono or stereo).
- Decode and play files (mp3, flac, wav, ogg, etc).
- Plot the waves.
- Math operations.
- Filters.
